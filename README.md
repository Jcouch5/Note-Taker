# To Do Note Tracker
In this assignment I added a Javascript backend through the use of node and express. I use routes in order to modularize the application. I created get, post, and delete routes for the deployed application. This application will allow the user to input a note to be stored and called on whenever the application is loaded. They can also delete notes.

## Link to Deployed Application
Hiroku is unable to link to GitHub at the current moment so I am unable to fully deploy the application
